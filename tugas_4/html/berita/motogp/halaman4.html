        <h3>Dovizioso: the attendance king</h3>
        <p align="right">
            The Italian, along with teammate Jorge Lorenzo, has been competing on the 
            World stage for 16 straight years - the thrid highest on the grid behind
            Valentino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) and Dani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda 
            Team). It's a huge testament to the 32-year-old, who in the last two years has 
            been - on paper - Marc Marquez' (Repsol Honda Team) most consistent 
            challenger.
